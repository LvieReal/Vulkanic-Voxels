# Agent Notes — Vulkanic Voxels

Working notes for AI agent sessions. **The chat is not persistent — read this
first.** Per-pass details live in the git log (one commit per pass, verbose
messages); this file keeps only what you need to work effectively.

## Project

Voxel world ray-traced in a Vulkan compute shader (one thread per pixel,
`resources/shaders/pixels_rgba.comp`), Qt 6 shell, C++23, CMake ≥ 3.26.
Owner's WGSL reference: `docs/reference_renderer.wgsl` (canonical look).

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/ui/` | Qt shell (`AppWindow`, `VulkanWidget` — swapchain + game loop) |
| `src/platform/` | OS abstraction (Win32/X11/Wayland/macOS) — keep OS headers out of the rest |
| `src/vulkan/` | `VulkanRenderer` (streaming, far LOD, frame loop), `VoxelResources` (GPU buffers) |
| `src/voxel/` | `World`/`Chunk`/`VoxelTypes`/`VoxelConfig` |
| `src/terrain/` | `Noise(2D/3D)`, `TerrainGenerator` (3D density terrain), `FarField` (far LOD + seam patch) |
| `src/render/` | Scene UBO, push constants, lighting config |
| `tests/` | CPU tests (no Qt/Vulkan), `ctest --test-dir build` |
| `scripts/build-linux-toolchain.sh` | Sandbox toolchain (see below) |

## Working rules (owner-set)

- One problem per pass; passes gated on owner verification.
- No TAA (removed pass 9 after owner decision). No SSAA (removed pass 10).
  One ray per pixel.
- User uploads never reach the sandbox — diagnose from code/math/probes.
- Mouse locked always; cross-platform abstraction stays.
- Uncapped fps default; `VV_PRESENT=fifo` restores vsync.
- Keep agent docs/toolchain inside the repo or home — `/tmp` gets wiped
  and the workspace gets rolled back occasionally (recovery: `git fetch
  origin <branch>` + `git reset --soft` + re-commit).

## Key contracts (sync points between CPU and GPU)

- Voxel atlas: 1 byte/voxel, 4 per u32, slot stride = padded chunk bytes;
  layout X + Y*sizeX + Z*sizeX*worldHeight.
- Height atlas: u16 per column (top+1, 0 = air), packed 2 per u32,
  X + Z*sizeX; `(sizeX*sizeZ+1)/2` words per slot.
- Chunk table: u32 slot per region cell, row-major; **triple-buffered**,
  selected by push `region.w`; `kEmptySlot` = air.
- Far field: u32 per cell = height u16 | type u8 << 16; **double-buffered**,
  selected by push `farParams.y`; `pc.far.z = 0` disables far LOD.
- Push constants (128 B): see `src/render/SceneData.hpp` — must match the
  shader's `Push` block exactly.
- Far grid is world-aligned (512-voxel snap): recenters shift the window,
  never re-quantize. Far seam band is patched from real chunk heightmaps
  (`FarField::patchRegion`, incremental, delta-uploaded).
- Streaming: generation on a worker thread (pump installs + fence-scoped
  uploads only); released slots have a 2-frame cooldown; region swaps are
  wait-free (no device/queue waits); teleport fallback stays synchronous.
- Terrain: density = clamp(g·(target−y)) + fbm3·amp, folds (overhangs) in
  mountains; defaults in `TerrainGenerator.hpp` (lift 36, ceiling 100,
  window (0.92, 0.995), snowLine 82). `maxHeightVoxels()` must stay ≤ 127.

## Environment variables

- `VV_DEBUG_TERM` — color miss pixels by ray-termination cause.
- `VV_DEBUG_HOLE=X,Z` — far-miss pixels over chunk (X,Z): magenta = empty
  far cell (data hole), cyan = data present but ray passed over (height
  too low), yellow = march never crossed the chunk.
- `VV_PERF=1` — log frames > 25 ms with the stream/world bucket.
- `VV_PRESENT=fifo` — vsync.

## Sandbox validation

```sh
export PATH=/tmp/deps/venv/bin:/tmp/deps/prefix/bin:$PATH   # symlink -> ~/.cache/vv-deps
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/tmp/deps/qt6;/tmp/deps/prefix"
cmake --build build && cmake --build build-debug   # both must be warning-free
ctest --test-dir build                             # all tests must pass
glslangValidator -V resources/shaders/pixels_rgba.comp -o /tmp/p.spv
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/deps/qt6/lib:/tmp/deps/prefix/lib \
    timeout 8 ./build/bin/game                     # must exit cleanly (Vulkan dialog, no crash)
# CPU tests without the toolchain:
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -ffp-contract=off -I. -Isrc tests/terrain_world_tests.cpp \
    src/terrain/{Noise,Noise3D,TerrainGenerator,FarField}.cpp \
    src/voxel/{Chunk,VoxelTypes,World}.cpp -o /tmp/t && /tmp/t
```

Toolchain: `bash scripts/build-linux-toolchain.sh` installs into
`~/.cache/vv-deps` (survives /tmp wipes) and symlinks `/tmp/deps` to it.

## Current status (pass 18)

Owner-verified pass 17: chunks generate in front; hitches gone; startup
instant (Debug build). Pass 18:

1. "Sorted backwards, farthermost first" - the worker pops the request
   queue from the BACK, but the top-up filled the backlog from the
   FRONT of the ascending-sorted pending list = with the WORST coords.
   The workers therefore ground through the list farthest-first. The
   top-up now iterates both lists in REVERSE (best first), so the
   backlog always holds the top-k and generation runs
   nearest-ahead-first.
2. "Hitch when entering ungenerated area" - the far seam patch scanned
   the whole region in one call (~630 chunks, 50-100 ms; the pass-15
   log's "far 96.8 ms" frame). Now SLICED: drainFarPatch scans <=16
   chunks per frame from updateWorld, extent grows only over chunks
   actually scanned. (Also fixed a latent bug: the old code marked the
   whole region box "patched" even when the chunks did not exist yet
   - async startup would have left edge estimates unpatched forever.)
3. Throughput: install cap 8 -> 16 per frame (fence-scoped uploads are
   sub-ms; the user asked), worker backlog 4 -> 6.
4. tasks.json for the owner's msys2 setup: Windows tasks use the full
   cmake path (C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/cmake.exe) with the msys2 bin
   prepended to PATH, generator switched MinGW Makefiles -> Ninja
   (ships with msys2 mingw64). Release is the default build task.

Gotchas: tabs (most src) vs 2-space (vulkan/render); edit_file fails on
deep-tab files — use python span edits; heredoc re-typing of code invites
typos — always verify anchors; `ctest`/`cmake` need the PATH export; a
bare-PATH commit silently fails.
